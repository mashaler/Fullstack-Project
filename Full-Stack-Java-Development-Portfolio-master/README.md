# Full-Stack-Java-Development-Portfolio
A brief showcase of my Java Full Stack development projects. This portfolio contains examples of work ranging from Java Spring Boot REST Services built with JDBC Template (such as Guess The Number Rest Service), to front-end React web applications (Investment Guild). The work displayed here illustrates a solid application of the fundamentals of Java programme structuring (e.g. CRUD/MVC design), as well as more advanced concepts such as Spring dependency injection and data persistence using SQL and JPA.

This work was produced during my time studying with the Software Guild as part of mThreeâ€™s Aspire Scholarship programme.
