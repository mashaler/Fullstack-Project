# Flooring Mastery

Flooring Mastery is an order management system written in Java. The programme allows the user to create, delete, update and search for flooring-material shipment orders. This work illustrates the fundamental concepts of Java in a business context, such as MVC architecture (including a service layer), Spring dependency injection, rigorous Unit testing, data persistence and appropriate money-handling using BigDecimal. 
Additional products and serviced tax-code areas can also be loaded in by adding them to the appropriate text files (e.g. Products.txt & Taxes.txt). All transactions are appropriately logged, to an external file (Audit.txt) for later inspection.
