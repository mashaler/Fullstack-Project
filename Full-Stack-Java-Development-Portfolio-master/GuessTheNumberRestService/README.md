# Guess the Number REST Service

Guess the Number REST Service IS A Spring Boot REST application created using JDBC Template, to access an SQL database. The application creates, retrieves, updates, and deletes data from the database to allow the user to play a simple number-guessing game, Cows & Bulls.

The code itself contains the required database configuration, as well as all game logic.
